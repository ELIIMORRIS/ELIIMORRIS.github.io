        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my portfolio!</p>
        <p>I am looking to contribute to innovative projects and grow in my professional career.</p>
        <p>My primary focus is on developing efficient, secure and scalable software. I have a keen interest in cyber security, cloud infrastructure and 
            evidence based digital analysis.</p>
        <p>I will be using this site to host projects, share my thoughts and what I've learned.</p>

        <h2>Education & Experience</h2>
        <p>I have lived a very interesting and varied life!</p>
        <p>Initially after finishing my A-Levels, I moved to London and studied Maths for a semester (simply because it was my strongest subject in college).
            During this period I began working full time in a call centre for market research, with the target audience being Welsh speakers. 
            I was absent from my course and withdrew during the second semester to continue working full time. When the contract finished, I worked
            in retail and hospitality, until I moved back to Wales in 2012. Here I continued working in retail while seriously considering my career options.
            I completed AAT Level 2 in Accounting, where we guaranteed to secure roles, however most of the students on the course
            were already working in a firm who was funding their course. From this I completed an access course in Nursing, where I aimed to work in a residential care home
            or as a healthcare assistant but was unable to secure a role. At a friend's birthday part in August 2013, a close friend from college had told me that he 
            had successfully been accepted to study in Swansea University and with his encouragement I visited the clearing website. Naturally I scrolled through the course
            subjects to Maths however following alphabetical order, I found Law. Some context, for A-Levels I studied Maths, Biology and History. I had never considered Law until
            that moment. As I read the course description, I became very excited and an interest was sparked. I wrote a thorough, passionate personal statement and I was offered a place to study.</p>
        </p>
        <p>I have a degree in Computer Science from the University of Example. I have worked on various projects, including web development, software engineering, and data analysis.</p>
        <p>My experience includes internships at leading tech companies where I honed my skills in programming, problem-solving, and teamwork.</p>
